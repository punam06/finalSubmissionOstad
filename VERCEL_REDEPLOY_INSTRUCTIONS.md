# üîß Fix for Vercel 404 Error - ACTION REQUIRED

## What Changed

I've fixed the Vercel configuration to properly serve your React app. Updated files:
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` - Corrected routing configuration for SPA
- ‚úÖ `frontend/vite.config.js` - Added base URL
- ‚úÖ Changes pushed to GitHub

## How to Redeploy on Vercel

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy (Fastest)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **final-submission-ostad**
3. Click on the **"Deployments"** tab
4. Find the latest deployment
5. Click the **three dots (...)** menu on the right
6. Click **"Redeploy"**
7. Wait for the deployment to complete (should say "Ready" in green)

### Option 2: GitHub Integration (Automatic)

The deployment will automatically trigger when you push to GitHub. Since I just pushed the fixes, check:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look at **Deployments** tab
3. Should see a new deployment in progress
4. Wait for it to complete

## Expected Outcome

After redeploy:
- ‚úÖ No more 404 error
- ‚úÖ Login page loads
- ‚úÖ React routing works
- ‚úÖ https://final-submission-ostad.vercel.app should be live

---

## If 404 Still Appears

Check these:

1. **Deployment Status**
   - Go to Vercel ‚Üí Deployments
   - Should show "Ready" (green) ‚úÖ
   - Look at "Build Logs" for any errors

2. **Browser Cache**
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
   - Or use Incognito/Private window

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set (if you want backend integration)

---

## What These Fixes Do

**vercel.json changes:**
```json
"routes": [
  { "src": "/api/(.*)", "status": 426 },     // Skip API routes
  { "handle": "filesystem" },                 // Handle static files
  { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }  // SPA routing to index.html
]
```

This tells Vercel:
- Don't try to serve `/api` routes (they're backend)
- Serve static files as-is
- For all other routes, serve `index.html` (React handles routing)

## Summary

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Code pushed to GitHub | ‚úÖ Done |
| Vercel config fixed | ‚úÖ Done |
| **Redeploy needed** | ‚è≥ YOU NEED TO DO THIS |

## üöÄ Next Step

**Go to Vercel and click "Redeploy"** on the latest deployment!

Then visit: https://final-submission-ostad.vercel.app

It should work! üéâ

## Questions?

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel Build Logs for errors
2. Verify GitHub integration is connected
3. Check that `frontend/` directory exists in repo

All config files are in GitHub now and ready to deploy!
