# Frontend (React) — Blood Management System

This is a minimal React scaffold using Vite. It is a starting point for building a SPA that talks to the Django DRF backend.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend API base is expected at `/api/` (same host) — you can configure a proxy in `vite.config.js` or use full URLs to your running backend.
